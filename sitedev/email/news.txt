We have a new monthly contest running Hole-in-One Challenge ( https://varyn.com?id=10004&e=1e7 ).
Play our Closest to the Pin game and see if you can score a hole-in-one. We will hold
a random drawing at the end of the month from all the registered participants for a Sony Playstation VITA™.

Here's a random fact: The famously awful E.T. game for the Atari 2600 actually sold
more units than Space Invaders, the platforms most well known game. E.T. sold 1.5 million units,
while Space Invaders only shot down one million units.

Let's play!
