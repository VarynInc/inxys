# The Information Exchange website (InXys)

Following up on the work of the Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES) of the mid-1970s to early the 1990s,
it seems many of today's information systems follow the simple forum model that lends to a free-for-all discussion format.
I wanted to leverage what we had learned in our research of connectivity and information systems to create
a better system.

## Information Model

Our information model is built around three core objects and the services that support them:

 - User
 - Group
 - Conference
 - Ticket
 
Users are the core of the system, representing the attributes assigned to individuals participating in
the information model. Groups are collections of users that can be assigned freely as an individual user and
in that context act as a collective user. A conference is a discussion by users focused on a particular topic.
Finally, tickets are privilege assignments made by users to other users on their behalf.
